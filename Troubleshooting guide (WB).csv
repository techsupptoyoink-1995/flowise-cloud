,Problems,Causes,Details,Solutions
,Colour Difference,Substrate Differences,The color and material of the paper used for proofing and actual printing are inconsistent.,Use paper materials consistent with those used for prrofing during bulk printing.
,Colour Difference,Color Confusion,"For the same Pantone number, different customers have different hues and formulas.",Standardize files so each Pantone number corresponds to a single color and a single file.
,Colour Difference,Printing Process Control,Ink thickening or excessive water addition during ther printing process,"Regularly test ink pH. If above 8.5, add pH adjuster; if below, use water to adjust viscosity and fluid balance."
,Colour Difference,Light influence,"Ink color perception is affected by illumination angle, intensity, and type of light source.",Use consistent lighting conditions and evaluate under a standard color-matching lightbox or D65 light source.
,Colour Difference,Exposure to light,"Standard color cards fade or change when exposed to sunlight or other light sources, causing mismatch with printed output.",Replace standard color cards regularly and store them in the same environment as printed documents to maintain consistency.

,Reduced Opacity,Fast Drying,Ink dries too quickly during printing,Add 3-5% slow-drying agent and retarder
,Reduced Opacity,Light pressure,Printing pressure too low,Increase printing pressure
,Reduced Opacity,New Scraper,Fresh scraper causes uneven print on large patterns.,Print small patterns first or switch ciolor group
,Reduced Opacity,Low surface tension,Excess glue on paper reduces ink transfer,Add 1-2% leveling and wetting agents.
,Reduced Opacity,Rough paper surface,Paper absorbs too much water and ink,"Increase ink viscosity and volume, or use lower line meh/rubber roller"
,Poor Overprinting,Based ink drying too slowly,"Viscosity too high, slows drying and affects overprint",Add 3-5% quick-drying agent and reduce based ink viscosity
,Poor Overprinting,Worn scraper on roller,Causes uneven ink transfer,Replace scraper or roller
,Poor Overprinting,Low top color pressure,Top color fails to adhere properly,Increase top color viscosity and pressure; add 1-2% leveling agent
,Screen Blocking,Improper viscosity,Ink too thick or too thin for screen mesh,Adjust viscosity to 9-13s
,Screen Blocking,Excess resin,High resin content clogs screen,Reduce resin ratio
,Screen Blocking,Plate wear or pressure,High pressure or aged plate causes blockage,Replace plate and reduce pressure
,Screen Blocking,Mismatched screen/plate,Screen mesh and plate not compatible,Match screen mesh to plate type
,Screen Blocking,Soft plate,Plate too soft to hold ink properly,Replace with firmer plate
,Screen Blocking,Worn scraper,Scraper unable to clean screen effectively,Replace scraper
,Screen Blocking,Long circulation,"pH drops over time., increasing viscosity",Maintain pH between 8.5 - 9.5
,Burr (Rough Edge),High viscosity,Ink too thick causes jagged edges,Reduce viscosity and clean plate
,Burr (Rough Edge),Fast Drying,Ink dries before proper transfer,Add slow-drying agent
,Burr (Rough Edge),Excess pressure,Too much pressure distorts edges,Adjust pressure
,Burr (Rough Edge),Plate wear,Worn plate causes uneven edges,Replace plate
,Burr (Rough Edge),Paper dust,Dust interferes with ink transfer,Filter ink frequently
,Smuding / Ink Rub-off,Low temp/high humidity,Slows drying and causes ink to smear.,Add 3-5% quick-drying agent or switch to faster-drying ink.
,Smuding / Ink Rub-off,Paper strip friction,Strip rubs against ink during handling,Adjust paper strip position
,Smuding / Ink Rub-off,Poor wear resistance,Ink lacks durability,Increase anti-wear agents
,Smuding / Ink Rub-off,Slow-drying overprint,Overprint layer dries too slowly,Use fast-drying ink and reduce base viscosity.
,Color Fading (Wear),High pigment content,Excess pigment reduces adhesion,"Use anti-wear ink, reduce pigment, increase antiwear agent."
